# Project Context: Raíces y Diseño Website

## 1. Project Goal

Build a super attractive, complete, and professional website for a high-end interior design and artisan furniture studio. The goal is to impress the business owner (the user's brother) and create a powerful tool for attracting clients.

## 2. Business Identity: "Raíces y Diseño"

*   **Core Business:** Artisan furniture (benches, lamps, armchairs), furniture restoration/cleaning, and educational workshops.
*   **Expansion:** Moving into full-service interior design.
*   **Brand Essence:** The name reflects the duality of the business:
    *   **Raíces (Roots):** The craftsmanship, the process, the raw materials, the story behind each piece.
    *   **Diseño (Design):** The final aesthetic, the professional vision, modern elegance.
*   **Key Asset:** An active Instagram account showcasing their work.

## 3. Website Vision: "The Digital Studio"

The website should be more than a simple landing page. It should be an immersive "Digital Studio" that tells a story and invites users into the creative process.

*   **Architectural Decision:** The site will be a **Multi-Page Website**. The Home Page will serve as a beautiful summary, with links to dedicated, in-depth pages for `Projects`, `Services`, etc. This approach is more professional, scalable, and better for SEO.
*   **Core Aesthetic: "Modern Warmth"**. This principle will guide all design choices, balancing a cozy, artisanal feel (wood textures, warm colors) with a clean, modern, and high-end layout (sharp typography, generous whitespace).

## 4. Agreed-Upon Structure & Features

*   **Home Page:**
    *   `Navbar`: Clean navigation.
    *   `Hero`: High-impact visual and headline.
    *   `FeaturedProjects`: A curated selection of top work.
    *   `Services`: A summary of offerings.
    *   `Testimonials`: Social proof.
    *   `CtaSection`: Clear call to action.
    *   `Footer`: Contact info and social links.
*   **Full Pages (Future):**
    *   `Portfolio`: Detailed project case studies (before/after, stories).
    *   `Services`: In-depth explanation of each service.
    *   `Courses`: Calendar, descriptions, and registration.
    *   `About Us`: The story of the founder.
    *   `Contact`: Form, WhatsApp, map.
*   **"Wow" Factor Ideas:**
    *   Dynamic, embedded Instagram feed.
    *   Interactive 3D furniture customizer.
    *   "Behind the Design" blog.

## 5. Tech Stack & Workflow

*   **Framework:** Next.js
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Workflow:** Start from a clean slate. Use v0.dev for UI inspiration and code generation. Iteratively build, review, and refine each component.

## 6. Current Status (as of 2025-06-25)

*   Project directory has been cleaned.
*   `src/app/layout.tsx` has been updated with SEO-friendly metadata and language (`es`).
*   `src/app/page.tsx` has been scaffolded with placeholder components for the entire home page structure.
*   **Next Step:** Design and implement the `Hero` section, starting with a detailed prompt for v0.dev.
